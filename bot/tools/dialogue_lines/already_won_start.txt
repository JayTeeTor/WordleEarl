Stop trying to ruin this for everyone else. You always do this.
Other people are still playing the game. Not everything is about you
Huh? What? Oh sorry, I’m still busy with the more interesting people that are still playing this game you’re trying to reset
Why are you doing this. You have an opportunity to make your first friends and you’re trying to ruin the game for them
Winning wasn’t enough huh. You just gotta gloat and try to do it twice. Typical
You already won. Perhaps you would like to try Turtle, the much better turtle guessing game that was absolutely copied from for this patchwork game
I know winning isn’t a normal thing for you but you can’t start another game
I know you don’t got a lot going on but you can’t just start another game after winning one
